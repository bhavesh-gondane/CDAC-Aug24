public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Main method with String[] args");
	}
	public static void main(int[] args) {
		System.out.println("Overloaded main method with int[] args");
	}
}


//OUTPUT:- Yes we can have many main methods but it executes only standard main method like String one.
